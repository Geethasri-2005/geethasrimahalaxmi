A startup is a newly established business venture, typically founded by entrepreneurs aiming to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. Startups are known for their innovation, agility, and potential for rapid growth, often operating in technology-driven industries. They begin with a bold idea, limited resources, and a strong vision, relying on creativity and resilience to solve real-world problems and disrupt traditional markets. Many startups seek funding from investors to scale their operations and turn their vision into a sustainable enterprise.
